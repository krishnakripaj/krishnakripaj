### Hey there 👋, you can call me Kripa!

I'm an educator 👩‍🏫 based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. I teach students how to use code to solve problems of their own 👩‍💻.
There are two things I like. Learning 📖 and teaching. Learning is easy, but teaching is a huge responsibility. But I like the challenge, so here I am.
